# MachineLearningProjects
Machine Learning projects by me.

Ive come to take this as a place where I can show off any neural network practice projects ive been doing.

The basic NN made was practiced from:

The NN framework is based on:

These were very informative on how to make NNs and they dive deep into the mathematics and the code behind neural networks.

> one day ill get to this lol.

> edit: I got to it :D
> Im using kaggle now since it has datasets that are free to use!
> Note: At the moment, this repo is almost entirely based off of the two videos mentioned above, but will be changed as I implement more layers/activation/loss/etc. and create neural networks for doing different things.
